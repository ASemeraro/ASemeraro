ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alessandra!

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), UX Research and problem solving. I have a Master's in HCI and Bachelor's in Computer Science and I find programming exciting, challenging and rewarding at the same time.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning new ways to do frontend, including React.js.
