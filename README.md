ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alessandra!

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), UX Research and problem solving. I have a Master's in HCI and Bachelor's in Computer Science and I find programming exciting, challenging and rewarding at the same time.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning new ways to do frontend, including React.js.

ðŸ’» Repositories I have contributed to on GitHub:

[1] https://github.com/riccardonuzz/aeonian

[2] https://github.com/mikaelamch/lighthouse

ðŸ¦Š Take a look at my GitLab page as well, if you are curious about some of my other work: https://gitlab.com/ASemeraro
